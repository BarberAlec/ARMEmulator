# ARMEmulator
**The ARM Interpreter.**

The ARMEmulator is an interpreter for the ARM instruction set.

Instructions:

-Open notepad and save a new file in the programs working directory called examples.txt.

-Go to your editors settings and ensure that tabs are not displayed using spaces (as is default on many applications).

-Write your ARM program using tab indentations before instructions always, no spaces between registers ( ADD r0,r1,r2) and all caps for instructions.

-For labels, begin the label without a tab and seperate the end of the label from the main instruction (if any) by a single space.
